# Contract-App
An app I developed for Quarter Note Music to make signing up for lessons to save paper and to increase organization.

You can find all the classes and code inside the folder "iPad Contract (Horizontal)".

It begins asking which semester you want to sign up in
It'll present many blank fields for the user to fill out like their name, email, instructor, etc.

It'll then show the contract and then an area to sign with their signature.

The last page presents all their entered data and allows them to change anything including their signature.
The last page also shows an option to sign up for the newsletter.

If everything looks good they can finish up and it'll send them an email with the attached PDF.
