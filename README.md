# Contract-App
An app I developed for Quarter Note Music during my final year of middle school. It was designed to make signing up for lessons to save paper and make it easier to manage customers.

This was the first major programming project that I've done.

You can find all the classes and code inside the folder "iPad Contract (Horizontal)".

It begins asking which semester you want to sign up in.
It'll present many blank fields for the user to fill out like their name, email, instructor, etc.

It'll then show the contract and then an area to sign with their signature.

The last page presents all their entered data and allows them to change anything including their signature.
The last page also shows an option to sign up for the newsletter.

If everything looks good they can submit it and it'll send an email with the attached PDF to both the customer and business owner.
